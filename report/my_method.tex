\subsection{Mixture Particle Filter}
In Mixture Particle Filtering (MPF), the particles $z_t^i$ are clustered into $M$ different mixtures $\calI_{m,t}$ and each mixture $\calI_{m,t}$ are assigned a weight $\pi_{m,t}$. When resampling, particles are draw from the following mixture distribution:
\begin{gather}
p(z_t|y^{t-1}) = \sum_{m=1}^{M}\pi_{m,t}p_m(z_t|y^{t-1}).
\label{trueMixture}
\end{gather}
The mixture components $p_m(z_t|y^{t-1})$ is approximated by 
\begin{gather}
	\hat{p}_m(z_t|y^{t-1}) = \sum_{i \in \calI_{m,t}}w^i_t\delta_{z_t^i}(z_t).
\label{mixtureCompontent}
\end{gather}
Inserting (\ref{mixtureCompontent}) into (\ref{trueMixture}) gives us the following approximation of $p(z_t|y^{t-1})$
\begin{gather}
	\hat{p}(z_t|y^{t-1}) = \sum_{m=1}^{M}\pi_{m,t}\sum_{i \in \calI_{m,t}}w^i_t\delta_{z_t^i}(z_t)
\end{gather}
where the weights $\pi_{m,t}$ and $w_i^t$ are computed as follows:
\begin{gather}
	\pi_{m,t} = \frac{\hat{\pi}_{m,t}}{\sum_{m'=1}^{M}\hat{\pi}_{m',t}}, ~\hat{\pi}_{m,t} = \sum_{i\in \calI_{m,t}} \hat{w}_t^i\\
	w_t^i = \frac{\hat{w}_t^i}{\hat{\pi}_{c_i,t}}, ~\hat{w}_t^i = p(y_t|z_t^i)w_{t-1}^i.
\end{gather}
It can easily be shown that this approximation is identical to the approximation used in normal particle filtering. For full derivation of the Mixture Particle Filter see \cite{vermaak2003maintaining}.

The difference between the PF and the MPF comes from the resampling step.
