\section{Related Work}
Several papers have acknowledge the weakness of particle filtering methods to maintain multi-modality. The authors in \cite{milstein2002robust} were the first to introduced clustered particle filters and the authors of \cite{vermaak2003maintaining} developed it further. The authors of \cite{milstein2002robust} introduced clustering of particles for robot motion to guard against premature impoverishment of particles when there are several equally probable modes. This is done by first clustering the particles and independently track the clusters. Each cluster is assigned a probability at a higher level so that the cluster with the highest probability was to correspond to the true robot position. The authors of \cite{vermaak2003maintaining} applied an improved version to one synthetic problem and football player tracking problem. The resampling method successfully keep both modes in the synthetic problem and track all players in the football problem.

In the context of multi target tracking, there are many different algorithms used. These algorithms usually fall into two different categories. The first is multiple instantiations of the sample tracker as in \cite{ras}. The second category explicitly extends the state space to track multiple objects \cite{hue}. To incorporate a varying number of targets, the state space can be dynamically changed to incorporate new or remove old targets, or indicators can be used to signify if a target is present or not.
