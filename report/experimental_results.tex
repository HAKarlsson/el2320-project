\section{Experiment and Results}
The comparison was conducted by tracking ants in a 1 minute long video. The accuracy of the algorithms at time $t$ was calculated as:
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{Accuracy}_t(A, P) = \frac{1}{20}\sum_{n=1}^{20}\mathrm{Represented}(A_n, P)
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the coordinates of the ants and $P$ is the set of particles. $\mathrm{Represented}(A_n,P)$ returns $1$ if there is a particle $p \in P$ that is not more than 16 pixels away from ant $n$.
