	Particle filters are a popular option for target tracking, however, they are known for being bad at maintaining multiple modes. Therefore, normal particle filters have problems with multitarget tracking. We tested 4 different resampling methods to address this problem on a dataset of 20 ants. These methods were the standard Systematic resampling, two versions of Clustered resampling and a method that uses multiple instances of a regular particle filter that we call MPF. The results showed that the MPF method was the most successful at tracking the ants but had lingering particles where no ants were present. The Clustered resampling using Lloyd's algorithm for clustering came in second place. The systematic resampling method was by far the worst resampling method.
